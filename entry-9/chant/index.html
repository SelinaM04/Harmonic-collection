            <h1>Ashtanga Yoga Chants</h1>
            <p>The practice of Ashtanga Yoga traditionally begins and ends with Sanskrit chants, which hold a significant place in the Ashtanga tradition. These chants serve as a means to express gratitude, dedication, and a sense of connection to the practice and its lineage.</p>
            
            <h2>Opening Chant</h2>
            <p>The opening chant is a way to pay homage to the lineage of teachers who have passed down the practice of yoga. It is a way of giving thanks to the ancient sages for their wisdom and acknowledges the profound connection between the practitioner and the teacher. The chant is seen as a way to purify the practice space and create a sacred environment for yoga.</p>
            <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong></p>
            <p>vande gurūṇāṁ caraṇāravinde<br>
                sandarśita svātma sukhāva bodhe<br>
                niḥśreyase jāṅgalikāyamāne<br>
                saṁsāra hālāhala mohaśāntyai</p>
            <p><strong>Translation:</strong> I bow to the lotus feet of the supreme guru<br>
                who teaches knowledge, awakening the great happiness of the self-revealed<br>
                who acts like the jungle physician<br>
                able to remove the delusion from the poison of conditioned existence.</p>
        
            <h2>Closing Chant</h2>
            <p>The closing chant is about universal peace and goodwill. It is a moment of reflection, expressing a wish for peace, happiness, and freedom for all beings. This chant helps to bring closure to the practice, allowing practitioners to feel a sense of harmony and connection with the world around them.</p>
            <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong></p>
            <p>svasti prajābhyaḥ paripālayantāṁ<br>
                nyāyena mārgeṇa mahīṁ mahīśāḥ<br>
                gobrāhmaṇebhyaḥ śubham astu nityaṁ<br>
                lokāḥ samastāḥ sukhino bhavantu</p>
            <p><strong>Translation:</strong> May all be well with mankind<br>
                May the leaders of the earth protect in every way by keeping to the right path<br>
                May there be goodness for those who know the earth to be sacred<br>
                May all the worlds be happy.</p>
        
            <p>Both chants are recited in Sanskrit, the classical language of India and the language of yoga. They are seen as a way to connect more deeply with the practice, transcending the physical aspects and touching the spiritual essence of yoga. The rhythm and vibration of the chants are believed to resonate with the heart, bringing a deeper sense of peace and presence to the practitioner.</p>
