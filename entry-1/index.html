                                <p>There have always been controversies about the origins of yoga, one of which is that originated from sex. Some articles have made statements that yoga originated from sex worship; Hatha Yoga is an offshoot of Indian Tantra, which worships and shares sextual behavior. Some articles also state that modern yoga still triggers aberrant sexual desires, and show sex scandals of famous yoga teachers to back this up.</p>

                                <h2>The Origin of Yoga</h2>
                                <p>Yoga has been practiced for more than 5,000 years since its origin. Archaeological excavations have proved that yoga was practiced in the Indus Valley civilization around 3000 BC. Among the relics unearthed at Mohenjo-Daro and his sister city Harappa were seals with images of gods sitting in meditation. At that time, the Aryans entered the Indus Valley and, in conjunction with the local natives, absorbed and passed on yoga as one of the key disciplines of their religious practice.</p>
                                <p>Contemporary philosophical researchers and yoga scholars, based on evidence and legends, imagined and described the process of the emergence of yoga: on the side of the Himalayas, there is a mountain as high as 8,000 meters high as the Mother of God, where there are many hermits, who, through meditation and austerity, many cultivated into saints, and began to be envied by a portion of the population to follow them, and these saints in the form of the secret method of cultivation will be passed on to the followers, which are the These sages taught their followers the secrets of their practice in the form of mantras, and this was the original Yoga practitioners.</p>
                                <p>The early practitioners of Yoga were ascetics who challenged nature at the foot of the snow-covered Himalayas all year round. To live a long and healthy life, they had to face "disease", "death", "body", "soul" and the relationship between man and the universe. To live a long and healthy life, one must face "disease", "death", "body", "soul" and the relationship between human beings and the universe. They carefully observed animals to see how they adapted to the natural life, how to implement effective breathing, food intake, excretion, rest, sleep, and overcoming diseases, and based on these observations, combined with the structure of the human body, each system, which is the origin of the yoga asanas. At the same time, they analyzed how the mind influences health, explored means of controlling the mind, and pursued ways to harmonize the body, mind, and nature, thus developing human potential, wisdom, and spirituality, which is the origin of Yoga Meditation. In the beginning, yoga practitioners were confined to Himalayan caves and the heart of dense forests, and later expanded to monasteries and country houses. When yoga practitioners enter the deepest level in deep meditation, they will get the combination of individual consciousness and cosmic consciousness, awaken the inner sleeping energy, get enlightenment and the greatest pleasure, which makes yoga has a strong vitality and attraction, and gradually spread among ordinary people in India.</p>
