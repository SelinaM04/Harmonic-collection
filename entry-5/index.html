            Pilates is a holistic fitness system that focuses on strengthening the core muscles, enhancing flexibility, and improving overall body awareness. It emphasizes controlled and precise movements, often performed on a mat or specialized equipment. Developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century, it incorporates principles such as concentration, control, centering, precision, and flowing movement. Pilates is known for promoting better posture, increased strength, and improved balance, making it a popular choice for people seeking a mind-body approach to fitness and well-being.

     <p><i style="font-size:18px" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>Yoga is an ancient practice with its roots in India, dating back thousands of years. It encompasses a wide range of physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines.</p>
     <p><i style="font-size:18px" class="fa">&#xf005;</i> Yoga has a strong spiritual and philosophical component. It incorporates principles like mindfulness, meditation, and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. Yoga includes various paths, such as Bhakti (devotion), Karma (action), Jnana (knowledge), and Hatha (physical postures).</p>
     <p><i style="font-size:18px" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>Yoga involves a wide variety of physical postures (asanas) that focus on flexibility, balance, and strength. These postures can vary greatly in complexity and intensity.</p>
     <p><i style="font-size:18px" class="fa">&#xf005;</i> The goals of yoga extend beyond physical fitness to include mental and spiritual well-being. Yoga is known for reducing stress, increasing flexibility, promoting relaxation, and enhancing mental clarity.</p>
