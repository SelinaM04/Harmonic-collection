      <h1>Weekly Mindfulness Moment: Breath Awareness</h1>
      <p>Mindfulness is the practice of bringing your full attention to the present moment without judgment. It's a powerful tool for reducing stress, increasing self-awareness, and enhancing your overall well-being. As Ashtanga yogis, we understand the importance of being present in our practice, and mindfulness is an extension of that awareness into our daily lives.</p>

    <div class="text-container second-text-container">
        <h1>Find a Quiet Space</h1>
        <p>Sit in a comfortable position in a quiet space where you won't be disturbed for a few minutes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container third-text-container">
        <h1>Day1</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 3 minutes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:At first my body was still tense, and after a few extended breaths the muscles in my body slowly began to relax. The first practice made it difficult for my nerves to focus on my breathing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container forth-text-container">
        <h1>Close Your Eyes</h1>
        <p>Gently close your eyes to reduce external distractions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container fifth-text-container">
        <h1>Day2</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 3 minustes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:This experience was better than the last one, although I haven't quite gotten the hang of controlling my breathing yet. It was tempting to open my eyes after about a minute or so.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container sixth-text-container">
        <h1>Focus on Your Breath</h1>
        <p>Begin by taking a few deep breaths to settle into the moment. Then, allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container seventh-text-container">
        <h1>Day3</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 5 minustes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:It was a calm day, so I got into the swing of things quickly. Listening to music, muscles were relaxed and focused. Felt relaxed and happy when it was over.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container eighth-text-container">
        <h1>Observe Your Breath</h1>
        <p>Pay close attention to the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest or the movement of your abdomen with each breath.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container ninth-text-container">
        <h1>Day4</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 5 minustes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:I adjusted the length of the meditation because I was enjoying the relaxation. The music allowed me to adjust my breathing quickly. My body was a bit tired after the meditation and I probably didn't adjust my sitting position.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container tenth-text-container">
        <h1>Stay Present</h1>
        <p>Your mind may wander. When it does, gently and without judgment, bring your focus back to your breath. Each time your mind drifts away, acknowledge it and return your attention to your breath.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container eleventh-text-container">
        <h1>Day5</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 5 minustes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:The room was colder today causing me to have a hard time concentrating in the beginning. The experience wasn't very good and it felt like time passed very slowly; the lack of control over the rhythm of my breathing caused me to want to give up many times.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container twelfth-text-container">
        <h1>Continue for a Few Minutes</h1>
        <p>Practice this breath awareness for 3-5 minutes, gradually extending the duration as you become more comfortable with the exercise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container thirteenth-text-container">
        <h1>Day6</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 5 minustes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:Today was a good day, still adjusting my breathing quickly, I opened the window and turned off the music. I heard dogs barking and cars honking outside my window. It seems that with my eyes closed, my sense of hearing becomes extra sensitive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container fourteenth-text-container">
        <h1>Expand Your Awareness</h1>
        <p>In the final moments of your practice, gradually expand your awareness beyond your breath. Begin to notice the sounds in your environment, the sensations in your body, and the thoughts and emotions that may have arisen during the practice. Embrace this expanded awareness as you transition back into your day, carrying with you the mindfulness and serenity you've cultivated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container fifteenth-text-container">
        <h1>Day7</h1>
        <p>Exercise length: 5 minustes</p>
        <p>Thoughts:A very relaxing day, it seems that five minutes of meditation is no longer stressful for me. During the meditation I felt the wind and the earth. When I close my eyes and focus on my senses, I can feel more from nature.</p>
