        <h3>Enhance Your Energy</h3>
        <H4>Crown:</H4>

        <p>Voice: OM. </p>

        <p>Make sure you feel warm and cozy, lying flat on your back. You can cover yourself with a blanket, gently cover your eyes with an eye pillow, and place a rolled up blanket under your knees or head. Spread your legs naturally hip-width apart and spread your arms out to the sides, palms up. Take a deep breath in, tense every part of your body, lift your head, arms and legs off the ground, hold for a moment, then release all parts of your body as you exhale through your mouth, repeat a few times. Visualize a lotus flower above your head, with each inhalation, divine light pours into the flower, and with each exhalation, let go of all thoughts that are troubling you. Hold for 5-20 minutes, then slowly bring awareness back to the breath, moving your fingers and toes to reconnect awareness to the body without losing connection to the Self.</p>
        <H5>Third Eye</H5>
        <p>Voice: OM. In a seated position, tuck one foot under the opposite knee and then the other. If your knee is higher than your hip, sit on a folded blanket. Hands can rest on your knees. Take 10 breaths, close your eyes and focus on the sound of your breath, holding the tip of your tongue against your palate as you inhale and relaxing as you exhale. The practice of the frontal chakra helps to improve concentration, and in this pose, you can easily gain a calm focus.</p>
        <H6>Throat</H6>
        <p>Lie flat on your back and support your shoulders with a folded blanket, head on the floor. Bend your knees, lift your hips, lift your legs, place your hands on your mid-back for support, lift one leg, gaze at the position of your heart, listen to the sound of your breathing and slowly lift the other leg, or one leg at a time. Hold for 2 minutes. To return, drop your feet to the floor above your head and place your hands on the floor, vertebrae by vertebrae slowly releasing your neck and back, turning to focus on the rhythm of your breath.</p>
        <H7>Heart</H7>
        <p>Kneeling on the mat, sit on your heels and lift your hips so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor, making sure your knees and feet are hip-width apart. Place your hands on your lower back with your fingers pointing upward and inward and your sacrum slightly downward while lifting the front side of your hips slightly upward. Tuck your chin toward your chest and slowly lean your body back, moving your shoulder blades toward each other on both sides, stopping here to breathe, or reach your hands straight up toward your heels. If you can, head back and stretch your neck. Pausing for a few breaths, withdraw your hands to your sacrum and sit on your heels with your hands folded. Camel Pose helps to open the heart, and you can imagine dedicating this asana to someone you love.</p>
        <H8>Solar-plexus</H8>
        <p>Sit with your legs in front of you, wrap your knees around your chest, slowly bend your knees so that your feet are off the ground and sit on your sitting bones for balance. Lift your chest and relax your shoulders. Slowly shift your center of gravity to the front of your sit bones, tucking in your abdominals and using your upper core. Extend your arms forward and straighten your legs. As you exhale, cross your arms over your chest and lower your legs until they are a few inches off the ground. On an inhale extend your arms and lift your legs back into boat pose. Repeat 5 times. Boat pose energizes the core and improves self-control.</p>
        <H9>Sacral</H9>
        <p>Feet apart, toes extended, hips back and down so that the knees correspond to the tops of both ankles. Place your hands on your thighs with your tailbone down and your pubic bone slightly up. Rock from side to side with deep breaths, moving your pelvis back and forth. You can also bend forward and place your arms between your feet, focusing on enjoying the process. Hold for 8-10 breaths. By gently opening the hips, you can focus on the abdominal chakra and experience the ebb and flow of energy with the slow rocking.</p>
        <H10>Root</H10>
        <p>Stand with your feet hip-width apart to create a stable root. As you exhale, relax your right leg at the knee, open your right foot to the right, and lift your right heel to the inside of your left thigh or inside of your left calf. Keep the standing left thigh lifted up powerfully and the left foot rooted toward the ground for balance. Extend your body upward from the top of your head, hold for 5 breaths and switch to the other side. Feel gravity helping you root toward the earth while experiencing how energy flows along the spine.</p>
